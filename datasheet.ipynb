    "# Datasheet for the NSL-KDD Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  The NSL-KDD dataset is a refined version of the original KDD Cup 99 dataset, designed to evaluate and benchmark network intrusion detection systems. Its purpose is to provide a standardized dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models in the cybersecurity domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intended Uses:**  \n",
    "  - Training and evaluating machine learning models for intrusion detection.  \n",
    "  - Research in anomaly detection, cybersecurity, and network traffic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Beneficiaries:**  \n",
    "  - Researchers and developers in the field of cybersecurity.  \n",
    "  - Organizations aiming to improve their network intrusion detection systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Description:**  \n",
    "  The dataset comprises network connection records with various features describing the behavior of the connection. Each record is labeled as either \"normal\" or as one of several types of attacks.  \n",
    "  - **Features:**  \n",
    "    - **Numeric Features:** e.g., `duration`, `src_bytes`, `dst_bytes`, and several others.  \n",
    "    - **Categorical Features:**  \n",
    "      - `protocol_type`: 3 unique values (e.g., tcp, udp, icmp)  \n",
    "      - `service`: 70 unique values (e.g., http, ftp, smtp, etc.)  \n",
    "      - `flag`: 11 unique values (e.g., SF, S0, REJ, etc.)\n",
    "  - **Label:** Binary indicator where:\n",
    "    - `0` denotes a normal (benign) connection.\n",
    "    - `1` denotes an attack (malicious connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size and Structure:**  \n",
    "  - **Training Set:** Approximately 125,973 records with 42 columns (including a \"difficulty\" column, which is typically dropped during preprocessing).  \n",
    "  - **Test Set:** Approximately 22,543 records with 41 columns (with proper alignment after adjustments).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Format:**  \n",
    "  - The data is stored in CSV files with each row representing a network connection and columns representing the features and label.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Collection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Methodology:**  \n",
    "  - The NSL-KDD dataset was derived from the original KDD Cup 99 dataset. It was created by removing redundant records and addressing some of the inherent issues in the original data.\n",
    "  - The records represent simulated network traffic and known attack patterns, making the dataset a useful benchmark for intrusion detection research.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timeframe and Geography:**  \n",
    "  - The original KDD Cup 99 data was collected in the late 1990s. NSL-KDD was subsequently released to address identified shortcomings.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:**  \n",
    "  - The dataset includes a curated set of network connection records to ensure a diverse representation of both normal and attack instances.\n",
    "  - The \"difficulty\" column in the training set indicates how challenging a record is to classify; however, this column is typically dropped during model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Preprocessing/Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Processing Steps:**  \n",
    "  - **Dropping the 'difficulty' Column:**  \n",
    "    The training set contains an extra \"difficulty\" column which is not used for modeling and is removed.\n",
    "  - **Handling Categorical Features:**  \n",
    "    - The categorical features (`protocol_type`, `service`, and `flag`) are one-hot encoded.\n",
    "  - **Feature Scaling:**  \n",
    "    - Numeric features are standardized (e.g., using StandardScaler) to improve model performance.\n",
    "  - **Alignment:**  \n",
    "    - Special attention is given to align the training and test sets (especially after one-hot encoding) to ensure both sets have identical feature columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Known Issues:**  \n",
    "  - Class imbalance: The dataset may have more instances of one class (normal) than the other (attack).\n",
    "  - Historical Bias: As the data is based on network traffic from the 1990s, it might not reflect modern attack vectors or network behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Intended Uses and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Use Cases:**  \n",
    "  - Research and development of intrusion detection systems.\n",
    "  - Benchmarking new anomaly detection and classification techniques in cybersecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Misuse:**  \n",
    "  - The dataset should not be used as a definitive representation of modern network traffic.\n",
    "  - Models trained solely on this dataset might not generalize well to current, real-world network conditions without additional, updated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Licensing and Distribution:**  \n",
    "  - The NSL-KDD dataset is publicly available for research purposes. Users should review the original licensing information provided with the dataset for details on its use and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Privacy:**  \n",
    "  - The dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII). It is based on simulated network traffic rather than real user data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Bias and Fairness:**  \n",
    "  - The dataset reflects the network conditions and attack types prevalent during its collection period.  \n",
    "  - There may be biases in the representation of different attack types, which could affect the generalizability of models trained on this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Usage Cautions:**  \n",
    "  - Researchers and practitioners should be cautious when applying models trained on this dataset to modern network traffic. It is advisable to supplement NSL-KDD with more recent data when deploying models in production.\n",
