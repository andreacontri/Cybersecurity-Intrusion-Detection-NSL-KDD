    "\n",
    "\n",
    " **Additional Metrics:**  \n",
    "- ROC and precision-recall curves were analyzed to select an optimal decision threshold.\n",
    "- The calibration process improved the reliability of predicted probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    " **Dataset:**  \n",
    "- NSL-KDD dataset (a refined version of the KDD Cup 99 dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    " **Data Composition:**  \n",
    "- **Features:** 122 features after preprocessing (including one-hot encoded categorical features for `protocol_type`, `service`, and `flag`, plus numerical features).\n",
    "- **Labels:** Binary labels where `0` represents normal (benign) connections and `1` represents attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Preprocessing Steps:**  \n",
    "- Dropped the extra \"difficulty\" column from the training set.\n",
    "- Cleaned and aligned the training and test datasets.\n",
    "- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features.\n",
    "- Scaled numeric features using StandardScaler.\n",
    "- Calibrated predicted probabilities using Platt scaling.\n",
    "- Adjusted the decision threshold based on ROC analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Known Limitations of the Data:**  \n",
    "- The dataset is based on network traffic data from the 1990s and may not fully represent modern network behavior or attack vectors.\n",
    "- Class imbalance is present, with fewer normal instances than attack instances (or vice versa, depending on the split).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Ethical Considerations and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    " **Bias and Fairness:**  \n",
    "- The NSL-KDD dataset may reflect biases inherent in its era and simulation process. Models trained on this data might not generalize perfectly to current real-world scenarios.\n",
    "- Care should be taken to supplement this dataset with more recent data when deploying in a live environment.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Privacy:**  \n",
    "- The dataset does not contain personally identifiable information (PII) and is based on simulated network traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Limitations:**  \n",
    "- While the calibrated and threshold-adjusted model shows promising performance on this dataset, further validation on contemporary and diverse datasets is required.\n",
    "- The extremely low decision threshold indicates that the raw predicted probabilities may be skewed; thus, calibration is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    " **How to Use the Model:**  \n",
    "- Load the preprocessed and scaled data.\n",
    "- Use the provided pipeline (including scaling and probability calibration) to generate predictions.\n",
    "- Adjust the decision threshold if needed based on your specific application’s tolerance for false positives versus false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Deployment Considerations:**  \n",
    "- Regularly monitor model performance and recalibrate if the underlying data distribution changes.\n",
    "- Consider integrating the model into a larger ensemble or system that combines multiple detection methods for enhanced reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Maintenance and Updates:**  \n",
    "- The model card and associated documentation should be updated as new data becomes available or if the model is retrained.\n",
    "- Continuous evaluation on recent network traffic data is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
